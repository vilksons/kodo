 **What is Kodo?**
  Kodo is a toolchain for SA-MP and Open.MP development built on C Code by providing a pure Compiler from Compuphase with updates provided. In Kodo Toolchain, users are given the freedom to update and even recompile after modifying. Kodo utilizes a single Linux Program file built on C with the help of Make, Makefile.., Linux Programs that allow users to run them in a Linux environment, such as WSL/WSL2/Docker or Termux and the like.

 **How to compile?**.
 You need [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) as default compilation, and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). For some external libraries, GCC requires **libm, libcurl, libarchive, readline, ncurses**.
