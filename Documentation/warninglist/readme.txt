200 symbol "foo" is truncated to foo characters
201 redefinition of constant/macro (symbol "foo")
202 number of arguments does not match definition
203 symbol is never used: "foo"
204 symbol is assigned a value that is never used: "foo"
205 redundant code: constant expression is zero
206 redundant test: constant expression is non-zero
207 unknown #pragma
208 function with tag result used before definition, forcing reparse
209 function "foo" should return a value
210 possible use of symbol before initialization: "foo"
211 possibly unintended assignment
212 possibly unintended bitwise operation
213 tag mismatch: expected foo foo but found foo
214 possibly a "const" array argument was intended: "foo"
215 expression has no effect
216 nested comment
217 loose indentation

220 expression with tag override must appear between parentheses
221 label name "foo" shadows tag name
